In the module, you find various trigonometric and exponential functions. In addition the two constants `pi` and `e` are included.

### Installed with Python by default

yes

### Example

Calculating a **square root**, a **sine**, an **exponential function** and a **logarithm**.

    >>> import math
    >>> math.sqrt(49)
    7.0
    >>> math.sin(math.pi / 2)
    1.0
    >>> math.exp(1.0) == math.e
    True
    >>> math.log(256,2)
    8.0
